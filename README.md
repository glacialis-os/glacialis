# GlacialisOS

This is an attempt to get something similar to [Project Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) or [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev/) running on [SwayFX](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx). Right now it is based on [Wayblue](https://github.com/wayblueorg/wayblue).

# Future Roadmap

- Make branding
- Get ISOs out
- Makes a website
- Move away from being based on Wayblue
- Get Stable and GTS images
